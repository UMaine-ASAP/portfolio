Summary
-------
### There is Limited Access to Student Academic Work
Any excellent academic work that might help employers find students (potential employees) is difficult to access at best. This means that it is hard for employers to compare students based on their actual work. The employer can has limited ability to see the level of student motivation and a complete list of their activities. It is also difficult for employers to get a sense of the university community, the level of academic commitment of students on a particular campus and the quality of academic work that is produced from the undergraduate community. This leads to the difficulty of comparing students from university to university, and how their work compares to students at different universities.


### There is a Lack of Involvement of Employers in Informing the Academic Paths with Market and Business Needs
While the job market affects what courses and information are important in a given academic path, the process is often delayed. Due to this many potential employees lack the skills that their field is using or is transitioning too. The lack of direct involvment of employers in informing academic paths means that students are not as focused on learning important information in their field as they could be.


### There is a Difficulty Connecting Student Skills to Jobs/Internships
It is difficult for employers to views student skills that might apply in the job market. Without seeing these specific skills it can be hard for match students to the jobs that would fit them the best.
