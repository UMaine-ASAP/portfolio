Summary
-------

### Feedback is not Comprehensive
Existing student feedback on work does not extend beyond the classroom or integrate well with external systems. While some feedback tools curently exist, expanding the scope of how work is viewed and the available feedback options will enhance learning and understanding. for example, grading and feedback tends to be limited to instructor responses and not include as much peer feedback. As well, viewing student work outside the classroom provides faculty with an opportunity to recognize and provide different feedback than rubric-based assessment.

### Communication Issues
Currently communicating student work is mainly accomplished through hearsay within a department. Often times, faculty need or want to demonstrate to their department, prospective students, a new class of students, or other sources excellence within their major or class. As well, sharing this work is difficult as their are no tools or mechanisms in place for maintaining and providing a consistent view of student work.

### Networking Issues
Currently, faculty networking and collaboration with students is difficult. Finding diverse students to work in a lab, especially students outside the major, is hard, especially without clear work to view. Similiarly, finding students for project collaboration outside of students met through classes is hard. Helping connect students to resources (such as potential employers) can also be difficult as tools for recommending and supporting student work do not exist.

### Lack of Ease of Access to Student Work (Access & Organization)
It is impossible for faculty to find exceptional student work without archiving class work on their own or networking with other class archivists. However, discovery of this work is difficult and archival and organization non-existent. Organizing, collecting, and showcasing excellent and representative work would strengthen a college's/department's/class's image to various audiences as well as provide a roadmap of a department's transition through the years. As well, faculty advisors would have a tool to track and view the development of a student throughout their time at the university.
