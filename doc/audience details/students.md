Summary
=======

## Limited Discovery Channels Exist
Limited discovery paths exist for students to discover work and demonstrate their own work. Students are left without a representation of their academic performance because they lack the tools to present and showcase their work to others. Finding people with similiar interests is also difficult, especially in other majors and colleges, however these works can serve as inspiration and motivation for academic excellence and potential collobration. Research into past work, for example grouped by specific class work, is impossible. Finally, without disemination avenues, students often find it difficult to demonstrate their work to a wide & diverse audience.

## Feedback is Limited or Non-Existant
Students currently have limited to no feedback on their academic work except classroom-based feedback. As a consequence, students do not have the tools for evaluating quality work or improving their own work behind limited inspection.

## Academic Work is not Collected nor Organized
Existing academic work is neither in one place nor organized. As a consequence, student work is fragmented according to individual classroom work and ill-representative of the entire academic experience. Students do not have a way of assessing progress over their 4 years because older work is forgotten or lost.

## Difficult to Share & Collaborate with Peers & Faculty
With the existing infrastructure, it is difficult for students to share and collaborate with peers & faculty. Sharing project work requires students to maintain multiple versions of work through email, implement custom team-based software solutions, or implement some other custom solution. As well, discovering potential collaborators (such as existing peer/faculty research opportunities or interested project partners) is often hard and limited to spontaneously discovered opportunities or opportunties & peers within the major. Connecting with peers for project work because of varying schedules and a multitude of device platforms also further compounds the issue.
