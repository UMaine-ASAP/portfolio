Portfolio System Audience Profiles:
===================================

Parents
-------
Parents of current and prospective students comprise a peripheral yet important audience for the portfolio system. Currently their access to student work is largely limited to what their child might choose to share with them or what they can glean from various 'featured student' columns throughout the university and department websites. 

#### Parents of Current Students:
- The portfolio system will provide an easy and accessable way to see the work that their child is doing while away at school. They will have access to other student's work as well which will allow them to easily guage how their student is performing compared with others in their department or even university-wide. 
- Parents will also be able to track their child's progress over time, and have a better sense of their ongoing development. 
- The portfolio system provides parents an easy way to share their child's work with others for several reasons, from simply showing off as a proud parent to showing work to potential employers or financial assistance sources (i.e. scholarship funds, etc.)

#### Parents of Prospective Students:
- Parents of prospective students would benefit greatly from the portfolio system by having access to a university-wide repository of student work that they could browse. With this tool they could invesitgate different majors and departments that would help them and their child make infromed decisions about where and what they would like to study, and gain a clear idea of the quality of the education and department that their child might enter into.
