Students

### Design considerations
Students are constantly coming to and leaving the university, providing a  perfect opportunity to introduce a new tool and integrate with both first years and graduate students.

1. Most students will be using the system in the moment for specific needs or to capture current work.
	- System should be designed around what current work looks like (both academic and non-academic)
	- Capture current classes?

1. Students have many demands and may have existing organizational structures in place. Consequently, they need the value of the tool to be clearly demonstrated. 
	- Need to include tools & benefits to clearly motivate uploading work (buy-in)
	- Case scenarios for uploading content should align with student needs
		- Soliciting peer feedback
		- Building portfolio for graduation

1. Students have busy schedules and need processes to be simple, fast, and easy to use. There should only be relevant, context-dependent options.
	- bulk file upload
	- match common work types
	- default templating and displays

### Description

#### Limited Discovery Channels Exist
Limited discovery paths exist for students to discover work and demonstrate their own work. Students are left without a representation of their academic performance because they lack the tools to present and showcase their work to others. Finding people with similiar interests is also difficult, especially in other majors and colleges, however these works can serve as inspiration and motivation for academic excellence and potential collobration. Research into past work, for example grouped by specific class work, is impossible. Finally, without disemination avenues, students often find it difficult to demonstrate their work to a wide & diverse audience.

#### Feedback is Limited or Non-Existant
Students currently have limited to no feedback on their academic work except classroom-based feedback. As a consequence, students do not have the tools for evaluating quality work or improving their own work behind limited inspection.

#### Academic Work is not Collected nor Organized
Existing academic work is neither in one place nor organized. As a consequence, student work is fragmented according to individual classroom work and ill-representative of the entire academic experience. Students do not have a way of assessing progress over their 4 years because older work is forgotten or lost.

#### Difficult to Share & Collaborate with Peers & Faculty
With the existing infrastructure, it is difficult for students to share and collaborate with peers & faculty. Sharing project work requires students to maintain multiple versions of work through email, implement custom team-based software solutions, or implement some other custom solution. As well, discovering potential collaborators (such as existing peer/faculty research opportunities or interested project partners) is often hard and limited to spontaneously discovered opportunities or opportunties & peers within the major. Connecting with peers for project work because of varying schedules and a multitude of device platforms also further compounds the issue.

Faculty
-------

### Feedback is not Comprehensive
Existing student feedback on work does not extend beyond the classroom or integrate well with external systems. While some feedback tools curently exist, expanding the scope of how work is viewed and the available feedback options will enhance learning and understanding. for example, grading and feedback tends to be limited to instructor responses and not include as much peer feedback. As well, viewing student work outside the classroom provides faculty with an opportunity to recognize and provide different feedback than rubric-based assessment.

### Communication Issues
Currently communicating student work is mainly accomplished through hearsay within a department. Often times, faculty need or want to demonstrate to their department, prospective students, a new class of students, or other sources excellence within their major or class. As well, sharing this work is difficult as their are no tools or mechanisms in place for maintaining and providing a consistent view of student work.

### Networking Issues
Currently, faculty networking and collaboration with students is difficult. Finding diverse students to work in a lab, especially students outside the major, is hard, especially without clear work to view. Similiarly, finding students for project collaboration outside of students met through classes is hard. Helping connect students to resources (such as potential employers) can also be difficult as tools for recommending and supporting student work do not exist.

### Lack of Ease of Access to Student Work (Access & Organization)
It is impossible for faculty to find exceptional student work without archiving class work on their own or networking with other class archivists. However, discovery of this work is difficult and archival and organization non-existent. Organizing, collecting, and showcasing excellent and representative work would strengthen a college's/department's/class's image to various audiences as well as provide a roadmap of a department's transition through the years. As well, faculty advisors would have a tool to track and view the development of a student throughout their time at the university.


Administration / Marketing
--------------------------

- The administration could be interested in needing someone with specials skills.
example: somebody who have certain skills in graphic design or a photographer to cover an event. Until now, people from administration are forced to send a general email to different teachers to find the right person.

- a system of "status" to say if this person is available to do some volontering or if she wants to be paid for that. Indeed in the past Sarah find somebody for a task thinking that this person is ok to be a volonteer. Once the task was accomplished the person wanted to be paid... Akward moment inside!

- Thus, the administration needs to be able to contact directly the student

- A system of portfolio could help the administration to "sort" the people for a task. They can easily discuss together if this student is more qualified for the task compared to another.

- Show off repository
	- At events, adminstration always needs images or stories of good student work and this would provide a perfect respository for that

- Public show off
	- The admistration always wants UMO to look good. â€ A system like this, allowing anyone to see the work being done should do just that.

- Administration could see which departments are actaully doing good work.


Prospective Students
--------------------

As a tertiary audience, perspective students also have many needs that the Portfolio System could facilitate.  Presently, perspective students have no window into the work being produced by current students of any level.  Access to the Portfolio System would allow these perspective students to see exactly what gets produced in many courses offered within their program of study.  This would give them the ability to more accurately assess their interest in the program and understand what paths are available to them.  There also is no current system in place which allows for the viewing of work done by faculty. Opening up this channel would allow for prospective students to not only view this work, but also provide a convenient location to contact a faculty member that specializes in their unique interests.  This combination of both student and faculty work would allow prospective students to see the major's/department's community as a whole and start to visualize themselves within it.  Lastly, being able to see the growth of a current student through the entirety of a program would give a prospective student insight into potential careers upon graduation.  Knowledge of the future is one of the primary decisions behind prospective students ultimately choosing a program to follow, thus the Portfolio System should be able to accommodate this need.

Parents
-------
Parents of current and prospective students comprise a peripheral yet important audience for the portfolio system. Currently their access to student work is largely limited to what their child might choose to share with them or what they can glean from various 'featured student' columns throughout the university and department websites. 

#### Parents of Current Students:
- The portfolio system will provide an easy and accessable way to see the work that their child is doing while away at school. They will have access to other student's work as well which will allow them to easily guage how their student is performing compared with others in their department or even university-wide. 
- Parents will also be able to track their child's progress over time, and have a better sense of their ongoing development. 
- The portfolio system provides parents an easy way to share their child's work with others for several reasons, from simply showing off as a proud parent to showing work to potential employers or financial assistance sources (i.e. scholarship funds, etc.)

#### Parents of Prospective Students:
- Parents of prospective students would benefit greatly from the portfolio system by having access to a university-wide repository of student work that they could browse. With this tool they could invesitgate different majors and departments that would help them and their child make infromed decisions about where and what they would like to study, and gain a clear idea of the quality of the education and department that their child might enter into. 

Potential Employers
-------------------
### There is Limited Access to Student Academic Work
Any excellent academic work that might help employers find students (potential employees) is difficult to access at best. This means that it is hard for employers to compare students based on their actual work. The employer can has limited ability to see the level of student motivation and a complete list of their activities. It is also difficult for employers to get a sense of the university community, the level of academic commitment of students on a particular campus and the quality of academic work that is produced from the undergraduate community. This leads to the difficulty of comparing students from university to university, and how their work compares to students at different universities.

### There is a Lack of Involvement of Employers in Informing the Academic Paths with Market and Business Needs
While the job market affects what courses and information are important in a given academic path, the process is often delayed. Due to this many potential employees lack the skills that their field is using or is transitioning too. The lack of direct involvment of employers in informing academic paths means that students are not as focused on learning important information in their field as they could be.

### There is a Difficulty Connecting Student Skills to Jobs/Internships
It is difficult for employers to views student skills that might apply in the job market. Without seeing these specific skills it can be hard for match students to the jobs that would fit them the best.
